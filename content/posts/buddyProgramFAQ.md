Which colleges should I apply.what is the criteria. will there be any partime available there for students..

- When should I start applying
- Should we compulsorily do the German certification course to come there for studies..
- Oh where did you learn german.I did a preliminary course from my college actually.
- Any trusted platforms....
- What do you prefer?
    - A skilled person with B.tech to Germany for work?
    - a Student coming there for Masters and getting a job there?
- Could you please let me know what are the skills that are on demand in the Computer science dept.

- My name is Hruthik, I hope you're doing well. I came across your profile and saw that you’ve studied and living in Germany, and I’d love to get some insights from your experience.

I’m planning to study in Germany and wanted to understand more about the education system, job opportunities, and overall experience of living there. Would you be open to sharing your thoughts on whether the course outcomes are worth the investment and how the job market is for international students?

- Hi Ram, I hope you are doing well. I have been admitted to IT & Automation at TH Koeln this winter semester, and I would like to get some information about it. Please let me know if you are available for a short chat. I appreciate your help.

Hi Priti,
Hope you are doing well!

Feel free to ask me anything related to TH Köln!
Even though my major isn't IT & Automation, I'll try my best to answer your questions :)

Thanks!
I am doing good. I hope you are doing well as well!
Actually, I am planning to finalize TH Koeln as the course structure looks mainly Industry oriented. How do you find the CS department?
Since the location is not precisely in Koeln, what about part-time jobs and Internship opportunities?
Also, I was planning to apply to Digital Sciences, but before that, I only received an admission. So what would you suggest? Which course has better opportunities?(Edited)

the CS department is pretty good in my opinion.
(i can only speak for courses in Digital Sciences, but) most, if not all of our Professors have worked before getting into academia, and hence they are able to explain the importance of the course content in real-life scenarios

as per the location, most of the people i know who work in Gummersbach have B1/B2+ German, so you can definitely find work here if your German is good enough
on the other hand, if your German is not good enough, you can try and find work in Köln, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Boon, Leverkusen, and other nearby cities

so, even though it is time-consuming (1.5hrs one-way), a lot of people just prefer to live in Köln coz of work (and quality of life, in general) and travel to the campus for class

Thank you very much for your detailed answers. It is really helpful.

i honestly cannot compare Digital Sciences and Automation & IT, because i am not familiar with the curriculum of the latter.
you can find all the courses in Digital Sciences here : https://digital-sciences.de/en/

i'd say you should choose a program which has courses that align with your interests, coz TH Köln is a pretty well-known Uni in Germany, and i dont think you can go wrong with either of the programs when you're looking for work.

We are glad to welcome you at Cologne University of Applied Sciences looking forward to a good cooperation. At the beginning of the Master’s course, you and all other students of the program are invited to the Academic Semester Orientation Thursday,...

no, we do not have classes everyday.
this is only the 2nd week since Jan '23 where i'll have classes everyday.

a lot of Professors like to take long classes (3/4+ hrs) on alternate weeks instead of 1.5/2hrs classes every week

living in Köln is great, but you should be aware of the infamous Deutsche Bahn strikes and constructions 😂

there is a construction planned from July to Dec this year, and the travel time will increase to at least 1.5hrs from Köln, depending on where you find a flat

View Ram’s profileRam Maheshwari
Ram Maheshwari  6:20 PM
yep, everything depends on the Profs

and unlike India, there isn't a "time-table" system here, so you will have to select courses which do not overlap each other

and if you want the grade in your transcript, you have to register for the exam separately.

usually, it’s done on PSSO (https://psso.th-koeln.de/qisserver/rds?state=user&type=0)

thanks for all the information. Yes I have received the smail id password. but I am really confused about how to select the courses. because there are mandatory modules. and is there any rule that we have to complete 30 credits per sem?

what is the exam process? is it going to be pen paper test or assignment based?

no, there are no “minimum” required credits per semester.

the exam depends on the professor.
i can’t really say how your exams are gonna be held, but it might be one of the following:
- presentation
- assignment/project throughout the sem
- pen & paper test
- online test (MCQs)
- 1 on 1 oral exam with the Prof.
(and any other method the Prof. likes)

for language courses, you can look at the Sprachlernzentrum page (https://www.th-koeln.de/en/international_office/language-learning-center_68235.php)

register for the B1 course here, and you would probably have to pass a test to get accepted to the course. all the details are usually sent out by email

I am nandini saini, a 4th year PhD student at IIT jodhpur.

How are you?

I have some queries about the EPITA exchange programme.

What is this? Is it useful for a PhD student? Is it complete free or some money need to pay if yes then how much cost?

Hello Nandini,

I don't really have a lot of information about the PhD exchange programme, as I was just a Bachelor's student when I went there.
You can have a look at this page to get the relevant contact information: https://www.epita.fr/en/contact-us/department-international-relations/

I personally did not have to pay any fees to EPITA. I had to just pay the annual fees to my home institution (SRM).

Overall, it was an amazing experience. I would definitely suggest you to consider spending a semester abroad (not just EPITA, any college would be amazing) if you get a chance!

What are the in demamd domains. Are you in a German public university. What was your intent while applying to them?

Ram Maheshwari sent the following messages at 3:16 PM

Ram Maheshwari  3:16 PM
there is no such "in-demand" domain;
you'll get jobs in pretty much everything related to CS, ranging from Cybersecurity, to Machine Learning

(you can check LinkedIn jobs for this: just change the region to Germany / whatever country you want to get a Masters from)

View Ram’s profileRam Maheshwari
Ram Maheshwari  3:18 PM
yes, I am in a German public uni.
i would suggest you not to apply to private colleges in Germany (there are A LOT of public colleges to choose from, and almost all of them are better than the private ones)

View Ram’s profileRam Maheshwari
Ram Maheshwari  3:25 PM
as per my intent behind choosing Germany, i just wanted to be somewhere in Europe
(i had spent around 7 months here in my undergrad, and loved it. if not for that, i would've definitely gone to the US, just like a dozen of my friends haha)

unlike India, people here don't really care about the college you graduate from: of course, the TU9 colleges might make you feel more confident, but the courses and the professors at every public uni in Germany are on par

it really depends on what you are interested in, and how the colleges you are applying to might help you in achieving your goals

i applied and got admitted to TU Berlin, TH Cologne, LMU Munich, and Uni Bamberg.
unfortunately because of a delay in my undergrad results, i could not enrol at TU Berlin (my 1st preference).
so, i ended up here at TH Cologne!
