### COL

(similar to my answer for the same question in [Germany FAQs](../germanyFAQ)):

varies vastly on your lifestyle.

rough estimate:

* rent: 600 (all the best finding a place üò≠)
* mobile phone: 20 (i used [Free](https://mobile.free.fr/fiche-forfait-free))
* misc.: 50
* food: 300
  * groceries: 200-250
  * restaurants: ~25 per visit, 4x per month = 100

managing your budget will keep the prices under 1000 per month in Paris. difficult, but doable.

### accommodation

#### what are the facilities available to us when we arrive at EPITA's off-campus residence Lion d'Or?

* kitchen
  * electric stove
  * oven
  * microwave
  * refrigerator
  * washing machine + dryer
* room
  * bed
  * mattress
  * comforter
  * pillow
  * cupboard
* WiFi

contact EPITA if you're unsure. the co-ordinators are very nice and will try their best to give you details of the appliances present.

#### where can i look for accommodation?

ask your Uni if they help with accommodation!

[CROUS accommodation!](https://refugies.info/en/procedure/609a9ff37e80e7001415cea1)

check websites like [PAP](https://www.pap.fr/), [leboncoin](https://www.leboncoin.fr/c/_immobilier_), [Seloger](https://www.seloger.com/), etc.

*beware of scammers!!*

### general questions

#### food?

cooking your meals at home is obviously cheaper.

[CROUS](https://www.crous-paris.fr/se-restaurer/nos-sites-de-restauration/) was a life-saver. subsidized meals for students!

finding vegan/vegetarian options should not be very difficult too!

#### bank account?

my exchange co-ordinator set up an appointment at the Kremlin branch of BNP Paribas for me and i had a good experience with BNP Paribas, so i would happily recommend it :)\
i'm pretty sure EPITA will help you if you ask for it!

#### residence permit?

honestly, i have no idea coz i didn't have to apply for one.

#### should i learn French?

yes.

#### how feasible is it to find an internship or job in France?

i'm not the best person to answer this question, sorry.

### public transportation

#### Navigo

if you live in IDF and are under 26, apply for the [Imagine R](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/imagine-r-student-ticket) ASAP.

#### V√©lib

i had a [V√©lib subscription](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en/offers#subscription) and i think it is worth it if you bike more than twice per month!

### EPITA / exchange

#### thoughts on EPITA, the faculty, and the overall value of the program

my specialization was [Information Systems Management](https://www.epita.fr/en/msc-computer-science-program-overview/), and i think the program is laid out very well!

the teachers are amazing, and were really helpful every step of the way :)

i didn't really pay anything to EPITA, so i would say it was 10/10 ;P

#### is a soft copy of the transcript sufficient for SRM?

YMMV but it was not enough for me.\
make sure to clarify this with your class teacher & exchange co-ordinator from SRM.

#### how long does SRM take to issue the transcript for the semester once they get our transcript from EPITA?

i did my exchange in the 8th sem, so it was a little complicated.\
it took around 25-30 days to get my final transcript in my case, but i've heard SRM will give you your result after you complete the pending courses (if any).

#### is an exchange program useful for a PhD student?

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è maybe?

i don't really have a lot of information about the PhD exchange programme, as i was just a Bachelor's student when i went there.\
you can have a look at this page to get the relevant contact information: [https://www.epita.fr/en/contact-us/department-international-relations/](https://www.epita.fr/en/exchange-erasmus-study-abroad/)

#### is an exchange program free?

i personally did not have to pay any fees to EPITA. i had to just pay the (normal) tuition fees to my home Uni (SRM). YMMV.

#### your overall exchange experience

an amazing experience.\
i would definitely suggest you to consider spending a semester abroad (not just EPITA, any college would be amazing) if you get the chance!
