> my major is [Dig. Sc. SAR](https://digital-sciences.de/studyprograms/software-architecture/index.html), so your questions might have a different answer depending on your uni and the course you enrol in.

#### how do you find the CS department?

the CS department is pretty good in my opinion.\
most, if not all of our Professors have worked in corporate before getting into academia, and hence they are able to explain the importance of the course content in real-life scenarios.\
a few courses also have projects which include working with companies, be it working with their employees, or working on the data provided to us in various formats.

#### i was planning to apply to Digital Sciences, but before that, I received an admission to Automation & IT.<br> what would you suggest? which course has better opportunities?

i honestly cannot compare Digital Sciences and Automation & IT, because i am not familiar with the curriculum of the latter.
you can find all the courses in Digital Sciences [here](https://digital-sciences.de/en/)

i'd say you should choose a program which has courses that align with your interests, coz TH Köln is a pretty well-known Uni in Germany, and i don't think you can go wrong with either of the programs when/if you're looking for work after graduation.

#### do you have classes everyday?

no, we do not have classes everyday.

a lot of Professors like to take long lectures (3/4+ hrs) on alternate weeks instead of 1.5/2 hr-lectures every week.\
you just have to make sure you do not select courses that overlap each other.

#### how to take the language course?

have a look at the [Sprachlernzentrum](<https://www.th-koeln.de/en/international_office/language-learning-center_68235.php>).\
iirc you have to pass a test to get accepted to courses higher than A1. all the details are usually sent out by email.

#### what is the examination process? is it mostly written, or assignment-based?

the exam depends on the professor.

i can’t really say how your exams are gonna be held, but it might be one of the following:

* presentation
* assignment/project throughout the sem
* pen & paper test
* online test (MCQs)
* 1 on 1 oral exam with the Prof. (and any other method the Prof. likes)

#### there are mandatory modules on my enrolment letter, what to do about them?

if there are mandatory modules listed, you obviously have to register for all of them.

#### is there any rule that we have to complete 30 credits per sem?

no.\
though the Ausländerbehörde will prolly not be happy if you're slacking off and take more than 2 extra semesters.

#### how to select the modules and register for the first semester?

use your smail (or campusID) to log in to [ILU](https://ilu.th-koeln.de/).\
navigate to the course and submit a request to join the course.\
we don’t really have a registration for all the courses in the semester; we can only register for courses individually.\
if you want the grade in your transcript, you have to register for the exam separately.
usually, it’s done on [PSSO](<https://psso.th-koeln.de/qisserver/rds?state=user&type=0>)

#### what about part-time jobs and internship opportunities in Gummersbach?

you can definitely find work here if your German is good enough. a couple of my friends also work at the TH as TA/RA!

you can also try and find work in Köln, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Bonn, Leverkusen, and other nearby cities
so, even though it is time-consuming (1.5hrs one-way), a lot of people just prefer to live in Köln coz of work (and quality of life, in general) and travel to the campus to attend classes.

#### Is it possible to get a RA/TA?

yes, it is possible to get a RA/TA position at the TH!
