- I recently got admission confirmation to EPITA for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence Systems, and I noticed that you have studied there. I would love to hear your thoughts on this institution or anyother, faculty, and the overall value of the program. Additionally, I am curious about the cost of living and finding an accomdation in Paris.

Furthermore, I have more experience in freelancing and teaching mathematics than in corporate roles, and I am a beginner in French. In your experience, how feasible is it to find an internship or job in France under these circumstances?

- Hey, this is Ram.
I'll be visiting EPITA as an exchange student from 17th January.
Can you answer few questions regarding that?

1. I've booked my accommodation at EPITA's off-campus residence Lion d'Or. What are the items available to us when we arrive? (e.g. kitchen appliances, utensils etc)

2.  How did you manage daily food? Did you cook every meal or ate at a canteen (if its available) or something else?

3.  What are the most important things to do once we land in Paris? (eg. bank account, residence permit etc)

Any other information you'd like to share would be of great help!
Thanks for your time!

Ok, so first of all it will totally depend on your apartment and the faltmates you get i.e what appliances they have purchased. But you will have the baisic like an electric induction or a gas to cook for yourself, you will have fridge and I think a washing machine too (I will repeat, it totally depends). Btw how did you book your residence? Through EPITA website or other sources. They might give you the details of the appliances present. If possible can you tell me your exact address.

I used to cook my daily food. I am a non vegetarian and as I had an oven too there was no problem for me. The bad thing is you won't find "roti" there. You will have to purchase the flour and then make everything yourself. I would suggest if you want eat rotis you can just buy tortillas from the stores otherwise use rice, bread, eggs, noodles, spaghettis, baguette, sandwiches, etc. There is a canteen available in school which is a bit reasonable otherwise the shops and restaurants are a bit expensive for daily food if you are on a budget. (I wasü•≤)

Well, I never made my residence permit so I don't know a lot about it. But if you are unsure about your health you should make one as it will allow you to avail free medicinal facilities. EPITA team will help you with the bank account thing. One other I will suggest is the navigo pass. I suggest you look about it before you reach france and apply for it as soon as possible (there is a monthly pass available i think). Navigo is a basic necessity in france if you are staying for a while cause it will alow you to have access to buses and metros unlimited for free( you just pay the monthly fees which will be discounted as you are a student)
BTW if you are a introvert studious type of guy who doesn't like going out or will go out only during weekends and will think you dont need a pass let me tell the transportation isn't cheap. You have to pay 2 euros for 1 trip one way i.e. around 180 per trip (times 2 if you wanna return) so apply for the NAVIGO asap.

I booked my residence via EPITA's off-campus housing.
This is a screenshot of the description of the room/flat:

Will look into the apartment and see if anyone lives here

Apply as soon as you reach there, as you will need a signed contract and I doubt you have it at the moment.
It takes around 3 weeks to come

Or 2

I don't remember exactly

Hey Vishal, I had a question

My Exchange Coordinator at EPITA said that I will be getting my Transcripts as Soft Copy. Is that sufficient for SRM?

Also, how long does SRM take to issue the Transcript for the semester after they get our Transcript from EPITA?

Yeah, for me it was enough.

SRM will give you your result after you complete the pending courses.
